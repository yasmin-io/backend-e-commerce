# Backend E-Commerce

---

Having a back end is a fundemental part of the electronics inductry, which means being a full-stack web developer is becoming more required than ever before. This project is to help me gain familiarity with using backend technologies, and utilise them to create a working Express.js API that will can use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The idea was to modify some starter code as though it were an e-commerce site looking to have a backend build for them using the latest technologies. I feel this project has helped me improve as a full-stack web developer and helped me gain a deeper understanding with routes and connections between models.

I have created a walkthrough video that will help you understand the full functionality of what I have built.

The video will demonstrate the following:

- How to create the schema from the MySQL shell.
- How to seed the database from the command line.
- How to start the application’s server.
- GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia.
